# The Broad Sound Taxonomy 
This repository contains information about the **Broad Sound Taxonomy**, a simple general-purpose taxonomy for the classification of a broad range of sounds.
This taxonomy organizes sounds into a two-level hierarchical structure comprising 29 classes: 
- 5 broad top-level categories
- 24 semantically finer second-level categories

A description and examples of each category can be found in the [`taxonomy_description`](taxonomy_description.ods).

## Taxonomy creation 
The taxonomy was developed based on principles and design criteria described in our [upcoming journal paper].

Supplementary material related to the taxonmy design is available in the `taxonomy_design/` folder. 
Materials include the [`design criteria scores`](taxonomy_creation/taxonomy_design_criteria_scores.ods), the [`tag_mappings`](taxonomy_creation/tag_mappings.csv), and the [`query_mappings`](taxonomy_creation/query_mappings.csv).

To support and refine the taxonomy, we conducted a user experiment. The sound files used in the experiment are hosted on [Zenodo](#). *(Link to be inserted)*
